For a fresh system install, from a minimal debian installation, just download and run:
userinstall.sh

Setup:
1) edit /etc/apt/sources.list , adding 'contrib' and 'non-free' to all of the repo entries
2) apt update
3) apt upgrade
4) apt full-upgrade
5) apt dist-upgrade
6) add any drivers/firmware
  (for my poke laptop,
   firmware-linux-nonfree
   firmware-b43-installer)

It will:
* download and install a minimal xorg setup with suckless tools
* setup dwm as the window manager
* check out your/our suckless tool repo
* compile the suckless tools from the repo to get the customizations
* setup pnminxer for volume controll
