For a fresh system install, from a minimal debian installation, just download and run:
userinstall.sh

It will:
* download and install a minimal xorg setup with suckless tools
** including drivers
* setup dwm as the window manager
* check out your/our suckless tool repo
* compile the suckless tools from the repo to get the customizations
* setup pnminxer for volume controll
